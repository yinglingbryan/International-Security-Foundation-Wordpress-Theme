# International Security Foundation - Wordpress Theme and Page Builder

This is a customized Wordpress theme developed to allow the client to manage thier own company website with ease.

In addition to provided an advanced and responsive front-end interface for the company website, it uses the Advanced Custom Forms plugin for Wordpress, in conjunction with a proprietary page builder system that I developed and integrated into the theme.  The page builder basically allows the client to build pages on the fly and add a number of different content-types to each.  Unlimited content blocks can be added and reordered on any page via the CMS.  Some advanced features include flexible e-commerce integration, a custom "Hero-Slider" generator, a flexible icon-box manager, and more.
